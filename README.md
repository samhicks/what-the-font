What the font
=============

A static web page for testing out fonts in your browser

About
-----

Inspired by a talk from Smashing Magazine on the redesign of their site at the Front Trends conference in Poland earlier in the year i've created What The Font.

Photoshop is no substitue for your browser when you're designing for the web so i've created this useful tool which allows you to test out web fonts you're thinking of using on a project before you commit. 

Nothing clever here, just a little front end magic which allows you to see how your font performs in a variety of different sizes and colours. I would recommend using in combination with [Browser Stack](http://browserstack.com/) for best results.

The fonts used here are either open source or reference Mac system fonts. Please use responsibly.
